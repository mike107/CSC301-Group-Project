## Numerical Series

The numerical series we'll be using to assign priorities to our user stories is a simple **1-5 series** (i.e. **{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}**) where **1** is highest priority and **5** is lowest priority.

The numerical series we'll be using to assign point estimates to our user stories is a **modified Fibonnaci series**:

**0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 80, 100, 400**

where **0** is lowest complexity and **400** is highest complexity.
