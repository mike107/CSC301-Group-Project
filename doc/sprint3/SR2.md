## What went wrong during the sprint?
* People were following different coding conventions which resulted in disorganized code.

* We refactored our code to satisfy the MVC design pattern which introduced several bugs.

## What went well during the sprint?
* We worked efficiently within the small amount of time we had during the sprint.
* Our team communicated well throughout the entire sprint.
* We commited more often which kept our development branch up to date.
* We completed more features compared to the previous sprint.

## What could we do differently to improve?
* Follow MVC design pattern from the start.
* Test the code thoroughly before you commit.
* We need to plan our workload more thoroughly.

## Best Sprint 2 experience
We got to work on and complete the most important features of our project such as creating and joining a session, student feedback and teacher analytics.

## Worst Sprint 1 experience
Not having standard coding conventions and not following MVC from the start resulted in messy code. It was a nightmare to debug.
