### Main Decisions

<b id="q1">How should we breakdown and assign the work for the Sprint 3 deliverables?</b>

It made the most sense to assign the work to Brandon since he did the documentation for the previous sprints.

We also decided to plan and practice the Sprint 3 Demo on Mar 22 from 1 to 3 PM which is our usual weekly meeting time. Due to scheduling conflicts, we've arranged to hold our demo on Mar 23 from 1 to 2 PM.

Lastly, we decided to hold our Retrospective Meeting right after our demo on Mar 23.

<b id="q2">What user stories are we working on for Sprint 3 Are we removing any user stories? Are we adding new user stories?</b>

Since this is the last sprint, we've decided to remove some siginificant user stories to simplify our workload while we focus on fixing bugs and polishing our final product.

In particular, we've decided to remove the Student Analytics user story. After reflecting on the amount of effort the Teacher Analytics user story required, we decided that we didn't have enough time to complete the user story to our satisfaction.

We've added a handful of small low priority user stories to make our application more user-friendly such as a 'Remember Me' feature for logging in and a 'Refresh Button' for the Teacher Analytics View.

A full breakdown of the user stories we've removed and added can be found in [**Sprint Goals**](#sprint-goals).
