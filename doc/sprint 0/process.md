## Team Organization

In terms of the roles each team member would take on, we decided not to assign any explicit roles to give each team member more flexibility in taking on different tasks in different phases of the project. This allows our team to be more flexible and robust against unexpected developments.

In order to organize and communicated with each other, we relied on WhatsApp Messenger and Slack. A project group was made on WhatsApp to handle instant messaging between all team members. Its primary purpose is to keep all team members connected and up to date with the current state of the project. We chose to use Slack to improve our team's workflow because of its usefulness as a collaboration platform.

## Decision Making 

We decided our decisions were to be made with two factors in mind; group consensus and a democratic and fair selection process. Any decision made by a member is to be done with the knowledge and approval of all group members. No major action is allowed to be taken without informing the group ahead of time or without approval. Thus, any major decisions must be discussed and agreed upon online or discussed further in detail in a meeting. 

We discussed a lot of our early ideas for projects through Slack first. This gave us more time to discuss what project we would decide on and how we would design it at our in-person meetings. Discussions are an open conversation in which any member can share their thoughts and ideas. 

When we had to make a decision with many different choices, we would put it to a vote. Since our group consists of 6 people, we decided we would only accept a decision if at least 4 members voted in favour of it.

## User Story Prioritization and Estimation

We decided to use a numerical scale to define user story priority. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the highest priority and 5 the lowest. For quantifying complexity, we decided on the modified Fibonacci sequence (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 80, 100, 400). 

It took a fair amount of discussion regarding the point scale before coming to a consensus. On average, it took us two rounds of voting before deciding on the priority scale. For the priority scale, some team members argued that a larger scale (1 - 10) would be better to accommodate the increasing number of user stories. In the end, we agreed upon the smaller scale (1 - 5) because of its simplicity. On the other hand, using the modified Fibonacci sequence to quantify complexity  was quickly agreed upon by everyone.

## Meetings

We decided that for all aspects of **Sprint 0**, we should hold bi-weekly meetings on campus for approximately 2-3 hours to discuss the project and all pre-development processes in the scrum (Scrum 0).  Aside from the in person meetings that we held for discussion purposes, we held small meetings using Slack. Slack is also useful for asynchronous communication since we can drop in at irregular intervals. We felt this meeting setup best accommodated the needs and concerns of each member.

## Next Phase

Into the next phase, we're taking forward 2 lessons to maximize our efficiency and work ethic. The first lesson is adopting a minimalist approach to ensure a focused and quality product in a short and busy amount of time. One way in which we'll try to achieve this is by discussing any extra ideas, features, or implementation details with 3 basic points in mind. Can it be done in a reasonable amount of time? Is it focused and cohesive with the goals of our project? And lastly, does it not impede the development of any more important features in progress. 

The second lesson we learned is that we should develop a rhythm to our meetings and workflow. The rhythm we define before an in-person meeting tells us a lot about whether the meeting will proceed smoothly or not. For example, if we're unable to focus on the topic at hand or are unsure about how to even approach a topic without further research, we'll end up wasting most of our meeting time.
