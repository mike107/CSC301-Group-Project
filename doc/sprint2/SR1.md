# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants
* **Shriram Anpalakan** (anpalaka)
* **Karan Bhagat** (bhagatka)
* **Hamza Ali** (alihamz2)
* **Brandon Villamor** (villamo3)
* **Mike Byun** (byundong)

## What went wrong during the sprint?
* Due to scheduling conflicts, we compressed all of our coding work into a short period of time instead of distributing it over the entire sprint.
* We had to transition from Firebase to Backendless as our database backend at the last minute due to Firebase's outdated Java API and documentation. This involved a lot of time having to learn a whole new API.
* We didn't always stay on topic during our meetings.

## What went well during the sprint?
* Our team communicated well throughout the entire sprint.
* Each team member had a great work ethic which resulted in finishing our coding work early.
* We met all our sprint goals.

## What could we do differently to improve?
* We could distribute the workload over the entire sprint instead of concentrating it into short periods of time.
* We could implement more features for Sprint 2 because we underestimated our team's velocity for Sprint 1.
* We could schedule meeting rooms well in advance so we don't waste any time trying to find a suitable meeting place on the day of the meeting.
* We could plan our week ahead of time to increase the probability of staying on or ahead of schedule

## Best Sprint 1 experience
The best Sprint 1 experience for all team members was being able to complete all of our Sprint 1 work well before the deadline in a very short period of time.

## Worst Sprint 1 experience
Unanimously, the worst Sprint 1 experience for the entire team was refactoring all of our initial code to satisfy the MVC design pattern. This made up most of our coding work.
